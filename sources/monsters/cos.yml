      Whenever it takes 5 bludgeoning or slashing
      damage at once, roll a d20: <b>1-8:</b> One leg is severed.
      <b>9-16:</b> One arm is severed. <b>17-20:</b> The zombie is decapitated.

      Severed parts are still considered part of the zombie.
      Arms and legs can move separately with a speed of 5 ft.
      An arm can make a claw attack with disadvantage. A
      head can make a bite attack, but the body is blinded unless
      the head can see it.

      Speed is halved if it's missing a leg. lf it loses
      both legs, it falls prone. If it has both arms, it can crawl. With
      only one arm, it can crawl at half speed. With
      no arms or legs, its speed is 0 ft.
