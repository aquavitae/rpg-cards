          of its next turn. On its turn, the target can't move, and it uses
          its action to make a melee or ranged attack against a randomly
          determined creature within range. If the target can't attack, it
          does nothing on its turn.
        - property | 2. Paralyzing Ray | The target must succeed on a DC 13
          Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The
          target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its
          turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
        - property | 3. Fear Ray | The target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom
          saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can
          repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with
          disadvantage if the spectator is visible to the target, ending the
          effect on itself on a success.
        - property | 4. Wounding Ray | The target must make a DC 13 Constitution
          saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) necrotic damage on a failed
          save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

        If the spectator makes a successful saving
        throw against a spell, or a spell attack misses it, the spectator
        can choose another creature (including the spellcaster) it can
        see within 30 feet of it. The spell targets the chosen creature
        instead of the spectator. If the spell forced a saving throw, the
        chosen creature makes its own save. If the spell was an attack,
        the attack roll is rerolled against the chosen creature.

        If the target is a creature
        against which the revenant has sworn vengeance, the target
        takes an extra 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage. Instead ofdealing
        damage, the revenant can grapple the target (escape DC 14)
        provided the target is Large or smaller.'
    - name: Vengeful Glare
      desc: The revenant targets one creature it can see
        within 30 feet of it and against which it has sworn vengeance.
        The target must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a
        failure, the target is paralyzed until the revenant deals damage
        to it, or until the end of the revenant's next turn. When the
        paralysis ends, the target is frightened of the revenant for 1
        minute. The frightened target can repeat the saving throw at
        the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if it can see
        the revenant, ending the frightened condition on itself on
        a success.
