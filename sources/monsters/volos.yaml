          choosing one or two targets it can see within 60 feet of it.
        - property | 1. Dazing Ray | The targeted creature must succeed on a DC
          12 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the start of the
          gazer's next turn. While the target is charmed in this way, its
          speed is halved, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls.
        - property | 2. Fear Ray | The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 12
          Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the start of the
          gazer's next turn.

        - property | 4. Telekinetic Ray | If the target is a creature that is Medium or
          smaller, it must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or
          be moved up to 30 feet directly away from the gazer.
        - If the target is an object weighing 10 pounds or less that
          isn't being worn or carried, the gazer moves it up to 30 feet in
          any direction. The gazer can also exert fine control on objects
          with this ray, such as manipulating a simple tool or opening a
          container.

        cast additional spells with her Innate Spellcasting trait (these
        spells are marked with an asterisk). If the staff is lost or destroyed, the hag must craft another, which takes a year and a

    - name: Maddening Feast
      desc:
        The hag feasts on the corpse of one enemy
        within 5 feet of her that died within the past minute. Each creature of
        the hag's choice that is within 60 feet of her and able
        to see her must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or
        be frightened of her for 1 minute. While frightened in this way,
        a creature is incapacitated, can't understand what others say,
        can't read, and speaks only in gibberish; the DM controls the
        creature's movement, which is erratic. A creature can repeat
        the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the
        effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is
        successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the
        hag's Maddening Feast for the next 24 hours.
