      desc: Serwyn can bring undead under his control, even those created by other
        wizards. As an action, choose one undead that he can see within 60 feet of him. That creature must
        make a DC 16 Charisma saving throw. If it succeeds, he can't use this feature on it again. If it
        fails, it becomes friendly to Serwyn and obeys his commands until he uses this feature again.
        Intelligent undead are harder to control in this way. If the target has an Intelligence of
        8 or higher, it has advantage on the saving throw. If it fails the saving throw and has
        an Intelligence of 12 or higher, it can repeat the saving throw at the end of every hour
        until it succeeds and breaks free.
  legendary_actions:
    - name: Summon undead (2/3)
      desc: Serwyn can raise any dead bodies (including those of fallen zombies or skeletons)
        within a 30 ft radius. If there are no bodies within range, he can summon 1d4 zombies

        and restores 1d4 + 4 hitpoints to it.
