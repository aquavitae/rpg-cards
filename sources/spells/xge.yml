  desc:
    - As you cast this, you use the rope to create a circle
      with a 5 ft radius on the ground. When
      you finish casting, the rope disappears and the circle
      becomes a magic trap.
    - It is nearly invisible, requiring a successful
      Investigation check against your spell save DC to be discerned.
    - The trap triggers when a Small, Medium, or Large
      creature moves onto the ground in the
      spell's radius. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be magically hoisted into the air,
      leaving it hanging upside down 3 feet above the ground. It is restrained there until the
      spell ends.
    - A restrained creature can make a DEX saving
      throw at the end of its turns to try to end the effect. Alternatively,
      the creature or anyone who can reach it can use an action to make an
      Arcana check against your spell save DC to end the effect.
      After it is triggered, the spell ends when no
      creature is restrained by it.
