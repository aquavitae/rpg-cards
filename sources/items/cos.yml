    A creature who ingests this poison must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving
    throw or take 3 (1d6) poison damage and become
    poisoned. The poisoned creature must repeat the saving
    throw every 24 hours, taking 3 (1d6) poison damage
    on a failed save. Until this poison ends, the damage
    the poison deals can't be healed by any means. After
    seven successful saving throws, the effect ends and the
    creature can heal normally.
