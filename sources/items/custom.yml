  description: This fine willow longbow has an obsidian stone set just above the grip,
    carved with the face of a wolf. It contains the spirit of a lawful good astral wolf.
  usage: |
    You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. While attuned to it, you gain advantage on
    social interactions with wolves and can speak with wolves.

    <b>Wolfshot:</b> <i>(Once per short rest)</i> When an arrow is fired a command may be given to release
    a spectral wolf along with the arrow. This attack is always made with advantage. On a hit the wolf bites
    the target dealing an additional 2d6 + 3 piercing damage and the target must make a DC 13 STR save or be knocked prone.
    The wolf disappears as soon as the attack finishes.

    <b>Assume Spirit:</b> <i>(Once per day)</i> A willing creature may use an action to touch the stone symbol
    and accept the spirit of the wolf, polymorphing into a Dire Wolf. The effect ends after 1 hour. A single attempt
    may be made to end this early by making a DC 13 Animal Handling check.
    While this is in effect, Wolfshot cannot be used.

    When an action is used to shatter the smoke bomb, it fills a sphere with a 10 foot radius with a thick cloud of black smoke,

    speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.

    <b>Blades' Fervour:</b> Once per day, for 1 minute, someone wielding both
    weapons can attune his mind to the minds in both swords, pushing himself
    beyond his normal limits as he allows the swords to take over. While under
    this effect he can make two strikes, one with each weapon, when making an
    opportunity attack, and opportunity attacks may be made using a reaction
    against anyone within melee range. However, when the effect ends, he takes 1 point of exhaustion.

    <b>Blade's Aversion:</b> Any attacks with either blade against someone wielding the other are
    at disadvantage and on a hit, both characters must make a DC 18 Strength save or be knocked prone.

  notes: >-
    Once awakened, this becomes a +2 longsword, dealing an additional 1d8 radiant damage. The blade itself becomes pure moonlight,
    and can be slid into or out of the hilt using a bonus action. It is the companion of the Sunblade, and when used together,
    the wielder gains an extra attack with one of the blades when both weapons are are used in an attack.
