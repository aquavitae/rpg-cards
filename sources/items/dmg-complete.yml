  Description: 'This item first appears to be a Large sealed iron barrel weighing
    500

    pounds. The barrel has a hidden catch, which can be found with a

    successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Releasing the

    catch unlocks a hatch at one end of the barrel, allowing two Medium or

    smaller creatures to crawl inside. Ten levers are set in a row at the

    far end, each in a neutral position, able to move either up or down.

    When certain levers are used, the apparatus transforms to resemble a

    giant lobster.


    The apparatus of the crab is a Large object with the following

    statistics:


    **Armor Class**: 20


    **Hit Points:** 200


    **Speed:** 30 ft., swim 30 ft. (or 0 ft. for both if the legs and tail

    aren''t extended)


    **Damage Immunities:** poison, psychic


    To be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. While the

    apparatus''s hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and

    watertight.  The compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of

    breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.


    The apparatus floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of

    900 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per

    minute from pressure.


    A creature in the compartment can use an action to move as many as two

    of the apparatus''s levers up or down. After each use, a lever goes back

    to its neutral position. Each lever, from left to right, functions as

    shown in the Apparatus of the Crab Levers table.

  Description: 'Inside this heavy cloth bag are 3d4 dry beans. The bag weighs 1/2
    pound

    plus 1/4 pound for each bean it contains.


    If you dump the bag''s contents out on the ground, they explode in a

    10-foot radius, extending from the beans. Each creature in the area,

    including you, must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 fire

    damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The

    fire ignites flammable objects in the area that aren''t being worn or

    carried.


    If you remove a bean from the bag, plant it in dirt or sand, and then

    water it, the bean produces an effect 1 minute later from the ground

    where it was planted. The GM can choose an effect from the following

    table, determine it randomly, or create an effect.


    =======  ================

    d100     Effect

    =======  ================

    01       5d4 toadstools sprout. If a creature eats a toadstool, roll any die.
    On an odd roll, the eater must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or
    take 5d6 poison damage and become poisoned for 1 hour. On an even roll, the eater
    gains 5d6 temporary hit points for 1 hour.

    02-10    A geyser erupts and spouts water, beer, berry juice, tea, vinegar, wine,
    or oil (GM''s choice) 30 feet into the air for 1d12 rounds.

    11-20    A treant sprouts. There''s a 50 percent chance that the treant is chaotic
    evil and attacks.

    21-30    An animate, immobile stone statue in your likeness rises. It makes verbal
    threats against you. If you leave it and others come near, it describes you as
    the most heinous of villains and directs the newcomers to find and attack you.
    If you are on the same plane of existence as the statue, it knows where you are.
    The statue becomes inanimate after 24 hours.

    31-40    A campfire with blue flames springs forth and burns for 24 hours (or
    until it is extinguished).

    41-50    1d6 + 6 shriekers sprout

    51-60    1d4 + 8 bright pink toads crawl forth. Whenever a toad is touched, it
    transforms into a Large or smaller monster of the GM''s choice. The monster remains
    for 1 minute, then disappears in a puff of bright pink smoke.

    61-70    A hungry bulette burrows up and attacks.

    71-80    A fruit tree grows. It has 1d10 + 20 fruit, 1d8 of which act as randomly
    determined magic potions, while one acts as an ingested poison of the GM''s choice.
    The tree vanishes after 1 hour. Picked fruit remains, retaining any magic for
    30 days.

    81-90    A nest of 1d4 + 3 eggs springs up. Any creature that eats an egg must
    make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, a creature permanently
    increases its lowest ability score by 1, randomly choosing among equally low scores.
    On a failed save, the creature takes 10d6 force damage from an internal magical
    explosion.

    91-99    A pyramid with a 60-foot-square base bursts upward. Inside is a sarcophagus
    containing a mummy lord. The pyramid is treated as the mummy lord''s lair, and
    its sarcophagus contains treasure of the GM''s choice.

    00       A giant beanstalk sprouts, growing to a height of the GM''s choice. The
    top leads where the GM chooses, such as to a great view, a cloud giant''s castle,
    or a different plane of existence.

  Description: 'This bag superficially resembles a *bag of holding* but is a feeding

    orifice for a gigantic extradimensional creature. Turning the bag

    inside out closes the orifice.


    The extradimensional creature attached to the bag can sense whatever is

    bag is devoured and lost forever. When part of a living creature is

    placed in the bag, as happens when someone reaches inside it, there is

    a 50 percent chance that the creature is pulled inside the bag. A

    creature inside the bag can use its action to try to escape with a

    reach into the bag to pull a creature out, doing so with a successful

    DC 20 Strength check (provided it isn''t pulled inside the bag first).

    Any creature that starts its turn inside the bag is devoured, its body

    destroyed.


    Inanimate objects can be stored in the bag, which can hold a cubic foot

    of such material. However, once each day, the bag swallows any objects

    inside it and spits them out into another plane of existence. The GM

    determines the time and plane.

    within it is transported to a random location on the Astral Plane.'

    The candle''s magic is activated when the candle is lit, which requires

    an action. After burning for 4 hours, the candle is destroyed. You can

    snuff it out early for use at a later time. Deduct the time it burned

    in increments of 1 minute from the candle''s total burn time.


    While lit, the candle sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius. Any creature

    within that light whose alignment matches that of the candle makes

    attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks with advantage. In

    addition, a cleric or druid in the light whose alignment matches the

    candle''s can cast 1st-level spells he or she has prepared without

    expending spell slots, though the spell''s effect is as if cast with a

    1st-level slot.


    Alternatively, when you light the candle for the first time, you can

    cast the *gate* spell with it. Doing so destroys the candle.'

  Description: 'This cube is 3 inches across and radiates palpable magical energy.
    The

    six sides of the cube are each keyed to a different plane of existence,

    one of which is the Material Plane. The other sides are linked to

    planes determined by the GM.


    You can use an action to press one side of the cube to cast the Gate

    spell with it, opening a portal to the plane keyed to that side.

    Alternatively, if you use an action to press one side twice, you can

    cast the *plane shift* spell (save DC 17) with the cube and transport

    the targets to the plane keyed to that side.


    The cube has 3 charges. Each use of the cube expends 1 charge. The cube

    regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.'

  Description: 'You can use an action to place this 1-inch metal cube on the ground
    and

    speak its command word. The cube rapidly grows into a fortress that

    remains until you use an action to speak the command word that

    dismisses it, which works only if the fortress is empty.


    The fortress is a square tower, 20 feet on a side and 30 feet high,

    with arrow slits on all sides and a battlement atop it. Its interior is

    divided into two floors, with a ladder running along one wall to

    connect them. The ladder ends at a trapdoor leading to the roof. When

    activated, the tower has a small door on the side facing you. The door

    opens only at your command, which you can speak as a bonus action. It

    is immune to the *knock* spell and similar magic, such as that of a

    *chime of opening*.


    Each creature in the area where the fortress appears must make a DC 15

    Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed

    save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In either case, the

    creature is pushed to an unoccupied space outside but next to the

    fortress. Objects in the area that aren''t being worn or carried take

    this damage and are pushed automatically.


    The tower is made of adamantine, and its magic prevents it from being

    tipped over. The roof, the door, and the walls each have 100 hit

    points, immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege

    weapons, and resistance to all other damage. Only a *wish* spell can

    repair the fortress (this use of the spell counts as replicating a

    spell of 8th level or lower). Each casting of *wish* causes the roof,

    the door, or one wall to regain 50 hit points.'

    <p class="type">Wondrous Item, Legendary</p>

    <div class="description"><p>Usually found in a box or pouch, this deck contains
    a number of cards made of ivory or vellum. Most (75 percent) of these decks have
    only thirteen cards, but the rest have twenty-two.</p><p>Before you draw a card,
    you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly
    (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). Any cards
    drawn in excess of this number have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw
    a card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card no more
    than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the
    remaining number of cards fly from the deck on their own and take effect all at
    once.</p><p>Once a card is drawn, it fades from existence. Unless the card is
    the Fool or the Jester, the card reappears in the deck, making it possible to
    draw the same card twice.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Playing Card</th><th>Card</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Ace

    Your mind suffers a wrenching alteration, causing your alignment to change. Lawful
    becomes chaotic, good becomes evil, and vice versa. If you are true neutral or
    unaligned, this card has no effect on you.</p><p><strong>Comet.</strong> If you
    single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or group of monsters you encounter,
    you gain experience points enough to gain one level. Otherwise, this card has
    no effect.</p><p><strong>Donjon.</strong> You disappear and become entombed in
    a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you were
    wearing and carrying stays behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared.  You
    remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere.  You can''t
    be located by any divination magic, but a <em>wish</em> spell can reveal the location
    of your prison. You draw no more cards.</p><p><strong>Euryale.</strong> The card''s
    medusa-like visage curses you. You take a -2 penalty on saving throws while cursed
    in this way. Only a god or the magic of The Fates card can end this curse.</p><p><strong>The
    Fates.</strong> Reality''s fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid
    or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card''s magic as soon
    as you draw the card or at any other time before you die.</p><p><strong>Flames.</strong>
    A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and plagues your
    life, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts
    until either you or the devil dies.</p><p><strong>Fool.</strong> You lose 10,000
    XP, discard this card, and draw from the deck again, counting both draws as one
    of your declared draws. If losing that much XP would cause you to lose a level,
    you instead lose an amount that leaves you with just enough XP to keep your level.</p><p><strong>Gem.</strong>
    Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 gp each or fifty gems worth 1,000 gp
    each appear at your feet.</p><p><strong>Idiot.</strong> Permanently reduce your
    Intelligence by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional
    card beyond your declared draws.</p><p><strong>Jester.</strong> You gain 10,000
    XP, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.</p><p><strong>Key.</strong>
    A rare or rarer magic weapon with which you are proficient appears in your hands.
    The GM chooses the weapon.</p><p><strong>Knight.</strong> You gain the service
    of a 4th-level fighter who appears in a space you choose within 30 feet of you.
    The fighter is of the same race as you and serves you loyally until death, believing
    the fates have drawn him or her to you. You control this character.</p><p><strong>Moon.</strong>
    You are granted the ability to cast the <em>wish</em> spell 1d3 times.</p><p><strong>Rogue.</strong>
    A nonplayer character of the GM''s choice becomes hostile toward you. The identity
    of your new enemy isn''t known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Nothing
    less than a <em>wish</em> spell or divine intervention can end the NPC''s hostility
    toward you.</p><p><strong>Ruin.</strong> All forms of wealth that you carry or
    own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses,
    buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any
    documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.</p><p><strong>Skull.</strong>
    You summon an avatar of death -- a ghostly humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered
    black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of the GM''s
    choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must
    win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points,

    ability scores by 2. The score can exceed 20 but can''t exceed 24.</p><p><strong>Sun.</strong>
    You gain 50,000 XP, and a wondrous item (which the GM determines randomly) appears
    in your hands.</p><p><strong>Talons.</strong> Every magic item you wear or carry

    11-90    The efreeti serves you for 1 hour, doing as you command. Then the efreeti
    returns to the bottle, and a new stopper contains it. The stopper can''t be removed

    If the bottle is opened a fourth time, the efreeti escapes and disappears, and
    the bottle loses its magic.

    91-00    The efreeti can cast the wish spell three times for you. It disappears
    when it grants the final wish or after 1 hour, and the bottle loses its magic.

    (Rare).</strong> These ivory statuettes of goats are always created in sets of
    three. Each goat looks unique and functions differently from the others. Their
    properties are as follows:</p><ul><li>The <em>goat of traveling</em> can become
    a Large goat with the same statistics as a riding horse. It has 24 charges, and
    each hour or portion thereof it spends in beast form costs 1 charge. While it
    has charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of charges,
    it reverts to a figurine and can''t be used again until 7 days have passed, when
    it regains all its charges.</li><li>The <em>goat of travail</em> becomes a giant
    goat for up to 3 hours. Once it has been used, it can''t be used again until 30
    days have passed.</li><li>The <em>goat of terror</em> becomes a giant goat for
    up to 3 hours. The goat can''t attack, but you can remove its horns and use them
    as weapons. One horn becomes a <em>+1 lance</em>, and the other becomes a <em>+2
    longsword</em>. Removing a horn requires an action, and the weapons disappear
    and the horns return when the goat reverts to figurine form.  In addition, the
    goat radiates a 30-foot-radius aura of terror while you are riding it. Any creature
    hostile to you that starts its turn in the aura must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom
    saving throw or be frightened of the goat for 1 minute, or until the goat reverts
    to figurine form.  The frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the
    end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it successfully
    saves against the effect, a creature is immune to the goat''s aura for the next
    24 hours. Once the figurine has been used, it can''t be used again until 15 days
    have passed.</li></ul></div>

  Description: 'When this 4-foot-tall mirror is viewed indirectly, its surface shows

    faint images of creatures. The mirror weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC

    11, 10 hit points, and vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. It shatters

    and is destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points.


    If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you are within 5

    feet of it, you can use an action to speak its command word and

    activate it.  It remains activated until you use an action to speak the

    command word again.


    Any creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated

    mirror while within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma

    saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it is wearing or

    carrying, in one of the mirror''s twelve extradimensional cells. This

    saving throw is made with advantage if the creature knows the mirror''s

    nature, and constructs succeed on the saving throw automatically.


    An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog

    that reduces visibility to 10 feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror''s

    cells don''t age, and they don''t need to eat, drink, or sleep. A

    creature trapped within a cell can escape using magic that permits

    planar travel.  Otherwise, the creature is confined to the cell until

    freed.


    If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells

    are already occupied, the mirror frees one trapped creature at random

    to accommodate the new prisoner. A freed creature appears in an

    unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing away from it. If

    the mirror is shattered, all creatures it contains are freed and appear

    in unoccupied spaces near it.


    While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can use an action to speak the

    name of one creature trapped in it or call out a particular cell by

    number. The creature named or contained in the named cell appears as an

    image on the mirror''s surface. You and the creature can then

    communicate normally.


    In a similar way, you can use an action to speak a second command word

    and free one creature trapped in the mirror. The freed creature

    appears, along with its possessions, in the unoccupied space nearest to

    the mirror and facing away from it.'

    flows from the brush to form the desired object as you concentrate on

    its image.


    Each pot of paint is sufficient to cover 1,000 square feet of a

    surface, which lets you create inanimate objects or terrain features --

    such as a door, a pit, flowers, trees, cells, rooms, or weapons -- that

    feet.


    When you complete the painting, the object or terrain feature depicted

    becomes a real, nonmagical object. Thus, painting a door on a wall

    creates an actual door that can be opened to whatever is beyond.

    Painting a pit on a floor creates a real pit, and its depth counts

    against the total area of objects you create.


    Nothing created by the pigments can have a value greater than 25 gp.

    If you paint an object of greater value (such as a diamond or a pile of

    gold), the object looks authentic, but close inspection reveals it is

    made from paste, bone, or some other worthless material.

    You can use an action to unfold a *portable hole* and place it on or

    **Anchor.** You can use an action to touch the token to a boat or ship.

    For the next 24 hours, the vessel can''t be moved by any means.

    Touching the token to the vessel again ends the effect. When the effect

    ends, the token disappears.


    **Bird.** You can use an action to toss the token 5 feet into the air.

    The token disappears and an enormous, multicolored bird takes its

    place.  The bird has the statistics of a roc, but it obeys your simple

    commands and can''t attack. It can carry up to 500 pounds while flying

    at its maximum speed (16 miles an hour for a maximum of 144 miles per

    day, with a one-hour rest for every 3 hours of flying), or 1,000 pounds

    at half that speed. The bird disappears after flying its maximum

    distance for a day or if it drops to 0 hit points. You can dismiss the

    bird as an action.


    **Fan.** If you are on a boat or ship, you can use an action to toss

    the token up to 10 feet in the air. The token disappears, and a giant

    flapping fan takes its place. The fan floats and creates a wind strong

    enough to fill the sails of one ship, increasing its speed by 5 miles

    per hour for 8 hours. You can dismiss the fan as an action.


    **Swan Boat.** You can use an action to touch the token to a body of

    water at least 60 feet in diameter. The token disappears, and a

    50-foot-long, 20-foot- wide boat shaped like a swan takes its place.

    The boat is self-propelled and moves across water at a speed of 6 miles

    per hour. You can use an action while on the boat to command it to move

    or to turn up to 90 degrees. The boat can carry up to thirty-two Medium

    or smaller creatures. A Large creature counts as four Medium creatures,

    while a Huge creature counts as nine. The boat remains for 24 hours and

    then disappears. You can dismiss the boat as an action.

    <p class="type">Wondrous Item, Rare</p>

    <div class="description"><p>This tiny object looks like a feather. Different types
    of feather tokens exist, each with a different single-use effect. The GM chooses

    You can use an action to touch the token to a boat or ship. For the next 24 hours,
    the vessel can''t be moved by any means. Touching the token to the vessel again
    ends the effect. When the effect ends, the token disappears.</p><p><strong>Bird.</strong>
    You can use an action to toss the token 5 feet into the air. The token disappears
    and an enormous, multicolored bird takes its place.  The bird has the statistics
    of a roc, but it obeys your simple commands and can''t attack. It can carry up
    to 500 pounds while flying at its maximum speed (16 miles an hour for a maximum
    of 144 miles per day, with a one-hour rest for every 3 hours of flying), or 1,000
    pounds at half that speed. The bird disappears after flying its maximum distance
    for a day or if it drops to 0 hit points. You can dismiss the bird as an action.</p><p><strong>Fan.</strong>
    If you are on a boat or ship, you can use an action to toss the token up to 10
    feet in the air. The token disappears, and a giant flapping fan takes its place.
    The fan floats and creates a wind strong enough to fill the sails of one ship,
    increasing its speed by 5 miles per hour for 8 hours. You can dismiss the fan
    as an action.</p><p><strong>Swan Boat.</strong> You can use an action to touch
    the token to a body of water at least 60 feet in diameter. The token disappears,
    and a 50-foot-long, 20-foot- wide boat shaped like a swan takes its place. The
    boat is self-propelled and moves across water at a speed of 6 miles per hour.
    You can use an action while on the boat to command it to move or to turn up to
    90 degrees. The boat can carry up to thirty-two Medium or smaller creatures. A
    Large creature counts as four Medium creatures, while a Huge creature counts as
    nine. The boat remains for 24 hours and then disappears. You can dismiss the boat
    as an action.</p><p><strong>Tree.</strong> You must be outdoors to use this token.
    You can use an action to touch it to an unoccupied space on the ground. The token
    disappears, and in its place a nonmagical oak tree springs into existence. The
    tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at the

  Description: 'While wearing this ring in dim light or darkness, you can cast *dancing

    lights* and *light* from the ring at will. Casting either spell from

    the ring requires an action.


    The ring has 6 charges for the following other properties. The ring

    regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn.


    **Faerie Fire.** You can expend 1 charge as an action to cast *faerie

    fire* from the ring.


    **Ball Lightning.** You can expend 2 charges as an action to create one

    to four 3-foot-diameter spheres of lightning. The more spheres you

    create, the less powerful each sphere is individually.


    Each sphere appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet

    of you. The spheres last as long as you concentrate (as if

    concentrating on a spell), up to 1 minute. Each sphere sheds dim light

    in a 30-foot radius.


    As a bonus action, you can move each sphere up to 30 feet, but no

    farther than 120 feet away from you. When a creature other than you

    comes within 5 feet of a sphere, the sphere discharges lightning at

    that creature and disappears. That creature must make a DC 15 Dexterity

    saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes lightning damage

    based on the number of spheres you created.

    **Shooting Stars.** You can expend 1 to 3 charges as an action. For

    every charge you expend, you launch a glowing mote of light from the

    ring at a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Each creature within

    a 15-foot cube originating from that point is showered in sparks and

    must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 fire damage on a

    failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.'

  Description: 'While holding this rod, you can use your reaction to absorb a spell

    that is targeting only you and not with an area of effect. The absorbed

    spell''s effect is canceled, and the spell''s energy -- not the spell

    itself -- is stored in the rod. The energy has the same level as the

    spell when it was cast. The rod can absorb and store up to 50 levels of

    energy over the course of its existence. Once the rod absorbs 50 levels

    of energy, it can''t absorb more. If you are targeted by a spell that

    the rod can''t store, the rod has no effect on that spell.


    When you become attuned to the rod, you know how many levels of energy

    the rod has absorbed over the course of its existence, and how many

    levels of spell energy it currently has stored.


    If you are a spellcaster holding the rod, you can convert energy stored

    in it into spell slots to cast spells you have prepared or know. You

    can create spell slots only of a level equal to or lower than your own

    spell slots, up to a maximum of 5th level. You use the stored levels in

    place of your slots, but otherwise cast the spell as normal. For

    example, you can use 3 levels stored in the rod as a 3rd-level spell

    slot.


    A newly found rod has 1d10 levels of spell energy stored in it already.

    A rod that can no longer absorb spell energy and has no energy

    remaining becomes nonmagical.'

  Description: 'This rod has a flanged head, and it functions as a magic mace that

    grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The rod has

    properties associated with six different buttons that are set in a row

    along the haft. It has three other properties as well, detailed below.


    **Six Buttons.** You can press one of the rod''s six buttons as a bonus

    action. A button''s effect lasts until you push a different button or

    until you push the same button again, which causes the rod to revert to

    its normal form.


    If you press **button 1**, the rod becomes a *flame tongue*, as a fiery

    blade sprouts from the end opposite the rod''s flanged head.


    If you press **button 2**, the rod''s flanged head folds down and two

    crescent-shaped blades spring out, transforming the rod into a magic

    battleaxe that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with

    it.


    If you press **button 3**, the rod''s flanged head folds down, a spear

    point springs from the rod''s tip, and the rod''s handle lengthens into a

    6-foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic spear that grants a +3

    bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.


    If you press **button 4**, the rod transforms into a climbing pole up

    to 50 feet long, as you specify. In surfaces as hard as granite, a

    spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole.

    Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart,

    forming a ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or

    lack of solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its normal form.


    If you press **button 5**, the rod transforms into a handheld battering

    ram and grants its user a +10 bonus to Strength checks made to break

    through doors, barricades, and other barriers.


    If you press **button 6**, the rod assumes or remains in its normal

    form and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing happens if this function of

    the rod is used in a location that has no magnetic north.) The rod also

    gives you knowledge of your approximate depth beneath the ground or your

    height above it.


    **Drain Life.** When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the

    rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving

    throw.  On a failure, the target takes an extra 4d6 necrotic damage,

    and you regain a number of hit points equal to half that necrotic

    damage. This property can''t be used again until the next dawn.


    **Paralyze.** When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the

    rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Strength saving throw. On

    a failure, the target is paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat

    the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on

    a success. This property can''t be used again until the next dawn.


    **Terrify.** While holding the rod, you can use an action to force each

    creature you can see within 30 feet of you to make a DC 17 Wisdom

    saving throw. On a failure, a target is frightened of you for 1 minute.

    A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of

    its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This property

    can''t be used again until the next dawn.'

    The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or become restrained.</p><p>You
    can release the creature by using a bonus action to speak a second command word.
    A target restrained by the rope can use an action to make a DC 15 Strength or

    by the rope.</p><p>The rope has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point
    every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the rope drops to 0

  Description: 'This 2-foot-diameter black sphere is a hole in the multiverse, hovering

    in space and stabilized by a magical field surrounding it.


    The sphere obliterates all matter it passes through and all matter that

    passes through it. Artifacts are the exception. Unless an artifact is

    susceptible to damage from a *sphere of annihilation*, it passes

    through the sphere unscathed. Anything else that touches the sphere but

    isn''t wholly engulfed and obliterated by it takes 4d10 force damage.


    The sphere is stationary until someone controls it. If you are within

    60 feet of an uncontrolled sphere, you can use an action to make a DC

    25 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a success, the sphere levitates in

    one direction of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to 5 x your

    Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet). On a failure, the sphere moves

    10 feet toward you. A creature whose space the sphere enters must

    succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be touched by it, taking

    4d10 force damage.


    If you attempt to control a sphere that is under another creature''s

    control, you make an Intelligence (Arcana) check contested by the other

    creature''s Intelligence (Arcana) check. The winner of the contest gains

    control of the sphere and can levitate it as normal.


    If the sphere comes into contact with a planar portal, such as that

    created by the *gate* spell, or an extradimensional space, such as that

    within a *portable hole*, the GM determines randomly what happens,

    using the following table.

    out to 300 feet. The target you hit must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving
    throw or become stunned until the end of your next turn.</p><p><strong>Lightning
    Strike.</strong> You can use an action to cause a bolt of lightning to leap from
    the staff''s tip in a line that is 5 feet wide and 120 feet long. Each creature

    You can use an action to cause the staff to issue a deafening thunderclap, audible
    out to 600 feet. Each creature within 60 feet of you (not including you) must
    make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6

  Description: 'This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2

    bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While you hold it, you

    gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls.


    The staff has 50 charges for the following properties. It regains 4d6 +

    2 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a

    d20. On a 20, the staff regains 1d12 + 1 charges.


    **Spell Absorption.** While holding the staff, you have advantage on

    saving throws against spells. In addition, you can use your reaction

    when another creature casts a spell that targets only you. If you do,

    the staff absorbs the magic of the spell, canceling its effect and

    gaining a number of charges equal to the absorbed spell''s level.

    However, if doing so brings the staff''s total number of charges above

    50, the staff explodes as if you activated its retributive strike (see

    below).


    **Spells.** While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend

    some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using

    your spell save DC and spellcasting ability:

    *conjure elemental* (7 charges),

    *dispel magic* (3 charges),

    *fireball* (7th-level version, 7 charges),

    *flaming sphere* (2 charges),

    *ice storm* (4 charges),

    *invisibility* (2 charges),

    *knock* (2 charges),

    *lightning bolt* (7th-level version, 7 charges),

    *passwall* (5 charges),

    *plane shift* (7 charges),

    *telekinesis* (5 charges),

    *wall of fire* (4 charges), or

    *web* (2 charges).


    You can also use an action to cast one of the

    following spells from the staff without using any charges:

    *arcane lock*,

    *detect magic*,

    *enlarge reduce*,

    *light*,

    *mage hand*, or

    *protection from evil and good*.


    **Retributive Strike.** You can use an action to break the staff over

    your knee or against a solid surface, performing a retributive strike.

    The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion

    that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it.


    You have a 50 percent chance to instantly travel to a random plane of

    existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you

    take force damage equal to 16 x the number of charges in the staff.

    Every other creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving

    throw. On a failed save, a creature takes an amount of damage based on

    how far away it is from the point of origin, as shown in the following

    table. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.


    =======================  ================================

    Distance from Origin     Damage

    If the effect causes you to cast a spell from the wand, the spell''s

    save DC is 15. If the spell normally has a range expressed in feet, its

    range becomes 120 feet if it isn''t already.


    If an effect covers an area, you must center the spell on and include

    the target. If an effect has multiple possible subjects, the GM

    randomly determines which ones are affected.


    The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend

    and is destroyed.


    =======  ================================

    d100     Effect

    =======  ================================

    01-05    You cast *slow*.

    06-10    You cast *faerie fire*.

    11-15    You are stunned until the start of your next turn, believing something
    awesome just happened.

    16-20    You cast *gust of wind*.

    21-25    You cast *detect thoughts* on the target you chose. If you didn''t target
    a creature, you instead take 1d6 psychic damage.

    26-30    You cast *stinking cloud*.

    31-33    Heavy rain falls in a 60-foot radius centered on the target. The area
    becomes lightly obscured. The rain falls until the start of your next turn.

    34-36    An animal appears in the unoccupied space nearest the target. The animal
    isn''t under your control and acts as it normally would. Roll a d100 to determine
    which animal appears. On a 01-25, a rhinoceros appears; on a 26-50, an elephant
    appears; and on a 51-100, a rat appears.

    37-46    You cast *lightning bolt*.

    47-49    A cloud of 600 oversized butterflies fills a 30-foot radius centered
    on the target. The area becomes heavily obscured. The butterflies remain for 10
    minutes.

    50-53    You enlarge the target as if you had cast *enlarge/reduce*. If the target
    can''t be affected by that spell, or if you didn''t target a creature, you become
    the target.

    54-58    You cast *darkness*.

    59-62    Grass grows on the ground in a 60-foot radius centered on the target.
    If grass is already there, it grows to ten times its normal size and remains overgrown
    for 1 minute.

    63-65    An object of the GM''s choice disappears into the Ethereal Plane. The
    object must be neither worn nor carried, within 120 feet of the target, and no
    larger than 10 feet in any dimension.

    66-69    You shrink yourself as if you had cast *enlarge/reduce* on yourself.

    70-79    You cast *fireball*.

    80-84    You cast *invisibility* on yourself.

    85-87    Leaves grow from the target. If you chose a point in space as the target,
    leaves sprout from the creature nearest to that point. Unless they are picked
    off, the leaves turn brown and fall off after 24 hours.

    88-90    A stream of 1d4 x 10 gems, each worth 1 gp, shoots from the wand''s tip
    in a line 30 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each gem deals 1 bludgeoning damage, and
    the total damage of the gems is divided equally among all creatures in the line.

    91-95    A burst of colorful shimmering light extends from you in a 30-foot radius.
    You and each creature in the area that can see must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution
    saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving
    throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

    96-97    The target''s skin turns bright blue for 1d10 days. If you chose a point
    in space, the creature nearest to that point is affected.

    98-00    If you targeted a creature, it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving
    throw. If you didn''t target a creature, you become the target and must make the
    saving throw. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is instantly
    petrified. On any other failed save, the target is restrained and begins to turn
    to stone. While restrained in this way, the target must repeat the saving throw
    at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect
    on a success. The petrification lasts until the target is freed by the *greater
    restoration* spell or similar magic.
